# Revenue Dashboard

In this project, I built an **Interactive Dynamic Dashboard** in Excel using Pivot Features, tables, and slicers. This dashboard provides insights into transactional historical data from 2024, with a total of 20,778 transactions. The data is spread across three worksheets and consolidated into one for comprehensive analysis.

## Aim

A web-based retailer wants to create a sales dashboard to analyze sales across different product categories. The corporation aims to track metrics such as profit, revenue, quantity, cost of goods sold (COGS), and transactions. Users can adjust settings to view trends by month.

## Prerequisites

- **Microsoft Excel**: Required for data analysis, pivot tables, and dashboard creation.

## Analysis Steps

1. **Data Consolidation**: Combined all data into one worksheet for analysis.
2. **Monthly Histogram**: Created histograms to analyze profit, revenue, etc., on a monthly basis.
3. **Revenue Comparison**: Analyzed revenue change compared to the previous month.
4. **Quarterly Analysis**: Prepared a table for quarterly financial analysis.
5. **Top Customers and Cities**: Created tables showing the top 5 customers by sales and the top 3 cities by sales.
6. **Trends Analysis**: Analyzed daily, weekly, and yearly sales trends.
7. **User Control**: Added a combo box for toggling between metrics like Revenue, Profit, and COGS.
8. **Dashboard Creation**: Designed a dashboard for visualizing key insights.

## Features

- **Interactive Controls**: Users can switch between revenue, profit, and other metrics.
- **Comprehensive Visuals**: Histograms, tables, and trend lines provide a detailed view of sales performance.
- **Top Performers**: Displays top customers and cities by sales for quick insights.
- **Trend Analysis**: Daily, weekly, monthly, and yearly trends for holistic sales tracking.
